# hugo-theme-even

This is my working fork of the [hugo-even-theme](https://github.com/olOwOlo/hugo-theme-even). My primary focus was to remove a lot of the undesirable cruft such as javascript, and other dependencies that added little to no functionality to the site.

## CSS
The theme utilizes [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) to build the CSS for the site.
I've utilized a C-wrapper called [sassc](https://github.com/sass/sassc).

### Building
To rebuild, simply type `make css` or `make`!
